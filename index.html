				<br>
				<li>1.Girls must not be married before attaining the age of puberty.</li>
				<br>
				<li>2.They must not be compelled to marry a man whom they don’t fancy.</li>

				<li>3.Even after marriage she should have the freedom to live apart from her husband; she shall not be put to shame on this score.</li>
				<br>
				<li>4.Girls must get an equal share in ancestral property.</li>
				<br>
				<li>5.After the husband’s death, women must be allowed to remarry.</li>
				<br>
				<li>6.Women who would prefer to remain spinsters must be allowed to do so, provided they are able to earn a living by business of handicraft, independently.</li>
				<br>
				<li>7.The condition laid on women that they must not speak to or associate with men other than their husbands must be removed, as this is born out of fear and jealousy.</li>
				<br>
				<li>8.Women like men, must be allowed the advantages of higher education in all the branches of knowledge.</li>
				<br>
				<li>9.If they are qualified to employ themselves in any government jobs, this must not be prevented by law.</li>
				<br>
				<li>10.There is now no use to pleas for women’s rights in government as even men in the country do not have it. However, if the country were to become independent soon women must be given a share in the government as men.</li>
